# Safira CLI

We believe that elaborating the specification file of the API before the development of it avoid having to revisit and reworking that many projects go through when the Spec doesn't deliver what the user needs, so we simplified the complexity and repeatability of steps that don't have added value to the developer during the construction process of the API, making the establishment of the development enviroment with agility, perfomance and escalability, raising productivity and improving the developers experience.
